# openvpn-operator
~~Painless deployment and management of OpenVPN on kubernetes~~

This software is far from being ready for general use and is only published for context on an [operator-sdk](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) demo.
Please do keep watching this space as i am planning on replacing the normal deployment method for [kube-openvpn](https://github.com/pieterlange/kube-openvpn) with an operator.
